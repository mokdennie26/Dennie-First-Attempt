		Hi I am Dennie xdxd
		How are you today xd
		xdxd
		I am thinking if there is a way to do something new
		and challenging in the HKUST so I learnt something
		that is completly difficult called Git, which is
		a version and resource control system... a distributed
		one stored a copy on your computer and a remote repository
		like github.
